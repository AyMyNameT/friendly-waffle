<!-- For the love of my good God, when you use "git commit", DON'T FORGET TO
USE "git push origin (branch goes here)" AFTERWARDS! -->

<!-- Another fun thing (and probably very necessary at some point), you can go back to one
point in time of the whole file by using "git restore --source (insert the code here)" to
go back to that specific point in time where the file was exactly the way it was left when push
was used during that timeframe. Fun. -->
