<!-- For the love of my good God, when you use "git commit", DON'T FORGET TO
USE "git push origin (branch goes here)" AFTERWARDS! -->

<!-- Another fun thing (and probably very necessary at some point), you can go back to one
point in time of the whole file by using "git restore --source (insert the code here)" to
go back to that specific point in time where the file was exactly the way it was left when push
was used during that timeframe. Fun. Of course, you'd have to commit the change, don't forget! -->

<!-- Another thing to note, the process so far; Use "git clone "insert github's link here", use "git log --oneline" to get all the
commits that have occured along with their codes so you can use "git restore --source __" if needed, and to commit, use "git commit",
use a dot at the end to apply to every single file, or specify is, then add a title to it (ITS NECESSARY) by using -m "title here".
To finish everything off, use "git push" to add all the commits to GitHub. Yea thats about it lol -->
